    <h1>Project Proposal: The Style Shaylist</h1>

    <h2>1. PROJECT CONCEPT</h2>
    <p><strong>The Style Shaylist</strong> is a styling and color coaching service designed to help clients find clarity in their wardrobe. The website serves as a digital storefront for Chroma Collective's styling concepts, focusing on <em>real bodies and real lives</em>.</p>

    <h3>Website Objectives</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Establish a professional online presence for color coaching services.</li>
        <li>Provide a clear <u>Service List</u> for virtual and in-person sessions.</li>
        <li>Allow clients to view a portfolio of style transformations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
    <p>The audience includes individuals experiencing life transitions, those feeling disconnected from their wardrobe, or anyone wanting to use <strong>color theory</strong> to build confidence without the pressure to buy more clothes.</p>

    <h2>2. SITE MAP</h2>
    <p>The website content will be organized into five primary pages to ensure user-friendly navigation. Below is the organizational structure:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Home:</strong> Introduction and "Get Shay'd" call to action.</li>
        <li><strong>About:</strong> I’m Shayla, the Founder of The Style Shaylist. As a stylist and color coach, I help clients see their wardrobe through a new lens, one where they feel aligned and entirely themselves.</li>
        <li><strong>Services:</strong> Detailed breakdown of sessions like the "Pre-Game Glow Up."</li>
        <li><strong>Gallery/Portfolio:</strong> Visual examples of color palettes and styling.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact:</strong> Inquiries and collaboration form.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The layout will prioritize a clean, <em>minimalist aesthetic</em> to reflect the clarity of the brand.</p>
